<h1>Networking Fundementals</h1>
<h2>Network Hardware</h2>
<div id="mainBody">
    <ul>
        <li>Router - A device that sends and receives data across computer networks. These are often mixed up with Hubs, Modems and Switches.</li>
        <li>Hub - A Hub is a device that connects to devices across Ethernet. A major downside to these are that they are vulnerable to attacks.</li>
        <li>Modem - A Modem connects to a Router (which is what a local network is connected to) and allows those devices to access the internet.</li>
        <li>Switch - A switch is a device that connects other devices together over a Local Area Network (LAN).</li>
        <li>Wireless Access Point - This device, also known as a WAP, enables other devices to wirelessly connect and access a wired network.</li>
        <li>Network Interface Card - An NIC is a component within hardware that allows it to connect to a network.</li>

    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Network Topologies</h2>
<div id="mainBody">
    <ul>
        <li>Bus - All devices are connected to a single cable called the bus or the backbone all and data travels along it.</li>
        <li>Ring - Each device is connected to two devices to create a loop, sending and receiving data that travels around the loop in one direction.</li>
        <li>Star - Each device is connected toa  central hub or switch, allowing for easier adding or removal of devices from the network.</li>
        <li>Mesh - Every single device is connected to each other, creating multiple paths for data transmission which is more resilient.</li>
        <li>Hybrid - A combination of multiple topologies. This can be done for reasons such as security, efficiency or simply cost.</li>
    </ul>
