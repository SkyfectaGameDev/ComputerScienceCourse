# Declare a string variable and name it plainText

# Assign to plainText user input

# If the user input is less than 6 letters, the program should output: "Not enough letters"

# How the cipher works:
# If the input is 
# WEAREDISCOVEREDFLEEATONCE 
# then the algorithm will sort it into columns
# The columns will look like this

# W E A R E D
# I S C O V E 
# R E D F L E 
# E A T O N C 
# E  

# Once they have been organised in this manner then the algorithm will choose the columns at random (Variables) in the following order

# 6 4 2 1 3 5
# W E A R E D
# I S C O V E 
# R E D F L E 
# E A T O N C 
# E  

# Then the algorithm will output the following data ROFO ACDT EVLN ESEA WIREE
