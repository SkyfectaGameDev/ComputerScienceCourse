# Step[1]
# User inputs two primary numbers 
# STRETCH - validate that the input is in fact a prime number

# Step[2]
# Multiply the two prime numbers and store in a variable
# This will be the modulus in the encyption and decryption keys

# Step[3]
# Find the amount of Co-Prime numbers with the number in Step[2]

# Step[4] - Encryption 
# Output the numbers which are
# between 1 and the number in Step[3], not inclusive
# and is Co-Prime with number in Step[2] and Step[3]
# Allow user to input the number they wish to choose from the list

# Step[5] - Decryption
# Output the numbers which are
# 1 when a number is multiplied with Encryption number, modulus Step[3] number
# Allow user to input the number they wish to choose from the list

# Step[6]
# Output to the encryption and decryption keys together with their modulus
# The format should be 
# ( ord(char)^encryptionKey ) MOD Step[2]
# ( ord(char)^decryptionKey ) MOD Step[2]
